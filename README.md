## About MU
[MU Hybrid Art House](https://mu.nl/en) is all about art in the broadest sense of the word. Together with mainly young makers and a broad, international audience, MU defines the liminal space between ‘what art is and what art can be’. MU is located in a former Philips factory at Strijp S in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.

Exhibitions and events at MU can be unpredictable, playful, touching, stimulating and visionary, and invite you to actively relate to the works and world around you. We preferably initiate, produce and present new work, surrounded by a stimulating secondary program in which we like to cross boundaries between disciplines. Thereby, we prioritize the introduction to, elaboration on and hands-on experience of the creation of art. Starting from the near past and present of contemporary visual art, we focus on the unpredictable future of tomorrow and beyond and the role that hybrid artists want ánd can play in it. We combine this with Eindhoven's innovative strength in the field of design and technology, together with an open, inclusive drive to experiment. MU is curious for talent, and challenges talents to be curious.
